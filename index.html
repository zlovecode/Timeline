            </h3>
            <p>
              Phython has really amazing features , it is very easy to
              learn,Python is more understandable means that it is readable.
              This makes Phython suitable for beginners, Python can run on
              different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh
              etc.Python language is free and available at to download and be
              written on sublime , Visual Code Studio , and Atom etc. Therefore
              it is open source and can be written seperatly.Python supports
              languages and if you know python you know any language, Graphical
              user interfaces can be developed using Python.It can be easily
              integrated with languages like C, C++, JAVA etc.

              it is an object obtained language.It is used for android apps and
              usally also used for desktop applications.Java offers a powerful,
              feature-rich, multi-paradigm, interpreted programming language
              with a moderate learning curve and high developer productivity.
              Java is strictly backward compatible, which is a crucial
              requirement for business applications. Java has never introduced a
              major breaking change like Python or Scala. As a result, it is
              still the number one choice for enterprises. Java’s runtime JVM is
              a masterpiece of Software Engineering and one of the best virtual
              machines in the industry. With 25 years of innovation and
              engineering craftsmanship, JVM offers high performance and
              features to Java. Also, JVM provides some advanced Garbage
              Collection to Java.

            <p>
              As C gave low-level access to memory and compiled to Machine
              instructions, it is one of the fastest and most powerful
              programming languages. C gives full control over the underlying
              hardware. C program can run on every platform and take advantage
              of every kind of hardware, whether it is GPU, TPU, Container,
              Cloud, Mobile devices, or Microcontroller. C is one of the
              “Programming languages of the Language,” i.e., compilers of many
              other programming languages like Ruby, PHP, Python have been
              written in C

            <p>
              Anders Hejlsberg did an excellent job to bring C# out of Java’s
              shadow and give its own identity. In terms of developer
              experience, C# is ahead of Java. Backed by Microsoft and being in
              the industry for 20 years, C# has large ecosystems of libraries
              and frameworks. The ASP.NET is used for Web Development,
              especially on Windows. Like Java, C# is also platform independent
              (thanks to CLR) and runs on Windows, Linux, Mobile devices.

            <p>
              Go has language-level support for Concurrency. It offers a CSP
              based message-passing concurrency via Goroutine (lightweight Green
              thread) and Channel. The biggest USP of Go is its language design
              and simplicity. It has successfully combined the simplicity and
              productivity of Python and the power of C. Go has embedded Garbage
              Collector (albeit not as mature as JVM garbage collector). Go
              developers can write system programming with the safety of Java,
              Python.

            <p>
              Ruby has combined some of the best features of programming
              languages successfully: dynamic, object-oriented, functional,
              garbage-collected, and concise. Although Ruby itself is not
              disruptive, its Web development framework Ruby on Rails is
              probably the most disruptive and influential Server-side Web
              development framework. Ruby is used by some of the largest
              software projects like Twitter, GitHub, Airbnb, and has excellent
              tooling and framework support.
